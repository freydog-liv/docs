title: "Unreal Core Architecture"

The LCK Unreal SDK is structured around a ULCKSubsystem (WorldSubsystem) that creates and owns a single ULCKService instance responsible for all recording, preview and telemetry operations, while the user-facing tablet is implemented as an ALCKTablet actor (BP_LCKTablet) that owns its own ULCKTabletDataModel (persisted settings) and ULCKUISystem (3D UI) and communicates with the service only via direct function calls.

| Component                                              | Role                                                                            | Lifetime                     | How to Access                                  |
| :----------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :--------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| **ULCKSubsystem**                                      | **WorldSubsystem** → creates and owns the single ULCKService instance           | World lifetime               | **GetWorld()-\>GetSubsystem()-\>GetService()** |
| **ULCKService**                                        | Central SDK brain: recording, preview, profiles, delegates, telemetry           | Singleton per player session | Always via **ULCKSubsystem**                   |
| **ALCKTablet **\+ **BP_LCKTablet**                     | Ready-to-use actor containing full 3D UI + recording logic                      | One per tablet in the Level  | Drop the provided **BP_LCKTablet **Blueprint   |
| **ULCKDummyRecorderController**<br />(will be renamed) | Handles record button state & timer                                             | Owned by ALCKTablet          | Used internally by the tablet                  |
| **ULCKUISystem**                                       | Full 3D UI orchestrator (all buttons, tabs, show/hide groups)                   | Component of the tablet      | Manages all UI components and data binding     |
| **ULCKTabletDataModel**                                | Central data container (mic state, quality, orientation, camera settings, etc.) | Owned by tablet              | All UI elements bind to it automatically       |

# Recording profile

Recording quality modes defined in the tablet.

| **Profile**            | **Resolution**               | **Framerate** | **Video Bitrate** | **Audio Bitrate** |
| :--------------------- | :--------------------------- | :------------ | :---------------- | :---------------- |
| **SD_30FPS (default)** | 960×540<br />(Soon 1280×720) | 30 fps        | 4 Mbps            | 128 kbps          |
| **HD_60FPS**           | 1920×1080                    | 60 fps        | 10 Mbps           | 256 kbps          |

For now tablet recording profile switching isn’t effective (it only visually updates the HD/SD button in the tablet, without the logic being bound) but will be functional in the next update.\
Editor-exposed settings panel will be added soon, in the meantime you have one temporary way to define your default recording profile.\
To define the default recording profile of your tablet, you may temporarily set it in **ALCKTablet::BeginPlay()**.\
\
\
**Important:**

Directly editing any **.cpp** file inside the plugin folder is **a temporary workaround** to update the default recording settings.

# Telemetry

- Telemetry is anonymous. **DeviceId** is an irreversible MD5 hash.
- Define the **TrackingID **inside **DefaultGame.ini **as shown in the section **“Preview Integration Guide”**

| **Event**                         | **Trigger**               | **Example context sent**     |
| :-------------------------------- | :------------------------ | :--------------------------- |
| **GameInitialized**               | Plugin loaded             | Engine version, graphics API |
| **ServiceCreated **/ **Disposed** | ULCKService init/shutdown | –                            |
| **RecordingStarted**              | User starts recording     | Resolution, FPS, bitrates    |
| **RecordingStopped**              | User stops recording      | Duration, stop reason        |
| **PhotoCaptured**                 | TakePhoto() called        | Resolution, format (PNG)     |
| **RecorderError **/ **SdkError**  | Any failure               | Error message + code         |
