Tablet UI comes from the **LCKUI** plugin. **LCKUI** is a 3D UI Framework.

## Enable interactions

Interaction with the UI is collision-based.

The simplest way to enable interactions is to add a **SphereCollider** with 5-10mm radius to the index fingertip.

Make sure that the collider has \*\*UICollision \*\*tag. It’s used to filter collision for UI.

## Enable grabbing

The UI doesn't handle Grabbing mechanics. Assume that it’s game-specific and it’s up to developers to integrate this.

This is an example of how you add the \*\*GrabComponent \*\*from the UE’s VR Template.

Make sure that you call **GrabStarted** and **GrabEnded** methods on \*\*LCKTablet. \*\*You can set them up in C++ or Blueprint.

## Sound and Haptic Feedback

**TabletDataModel** has a broadcast for a UI element being pressed. You can subscribe your own implementation to it.

## Emission && Lighting

Depending on how you use real-time lighting in your game you might want to tweak emission strength on the UI materials.

## UI Customization

UI visuals defined by the **UITexture** asset. Update it to change the UI look.

Update **LCKTabletTexture** asset to change how the tablet looks.

A Figma source file will be share later.
