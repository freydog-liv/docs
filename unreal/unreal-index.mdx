## Unreal LCK Open Beta

The camera system is fully functional.  You'll have all the camera views, Meta Quest and PC video and photo capture, and an out-of-the-box blueprint to add to your app.

We haven't tested every possible game configuration yet. We need your help validating compatibility across different plugin combinations, interaction frameworks, audio systems, and custom game mechanics.

### What's not included or confirmed in the Open Beta

- Live Streaming is not yet supported
- Meta Unreal Fork configurations
- Unreal VR Expansion plugin
- Ray-cast interaction systems
