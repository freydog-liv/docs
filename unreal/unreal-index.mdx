## Unreal LCK Open Beta

The Unreal LIV Camera system is fully functional.  You'll have all the camera views, Meta Quest video and photo capture direct to device, and an out-of-the-box blueprint to add to your app.

We haven't tested every possible game configuration yet. We need your help validating compatibility across different plugin combinations, interaction frameworks, audio systems, and custom game mechanics.

You can release your game with this SDK version.  As we're still in Beta we expect to do frequent patches in the coming weeks.  Join our Discord and get the latest updates.

Please let us know when you release your app with LIV Camera, we'd love to let our community know.

### What's not included or confirmed in the Open Beta

- PCVR Support (Coming soon)
- Live Streaming is not yet supported
- Meta Unreal Fork configurations
- Unreal VR Expansion plugin
- Ray-cast interaction systems
