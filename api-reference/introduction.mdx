## About

The **LCK API** is accessed through the `LckService` class. To get started, create a service instance using the static `CreateService` function, providing an `LckDescriptor` that defines your desired track settings.

Once the service is created, you can select the camera to capture from by calling `SetActiveCamera` with the ID of the target LCK camera.

From there, recording is managed with the straightforward `StartRecording` and `StopRecording` functions.
