## Description

`ILckMonitor` is an interface representing a monitor endpoint within LCK. Monitors act as render targets for camera outputs, identified by a unique `MonitorId`.

Any class implementing this interface can be registered with the LCK system to receive video frames via a `RenderTexture`.

---

## Usage

To implement a custom monitor, create a class that implements `ILckMonitor` and register it with the system. See `LckMonitor` for a simple example.
