title: "ILckCamera"
description: "Interface representing a camera that can be activated, deactivated, and managed in the LCK capture system."
---

## Description

`ILckCamera` defines the contract for cameras managed within LCK. It ensures every camera has a **unique identifier** (`CameraId`), can be **activated or deactivated** with a `RenderTexture` as its output target, and exposes its Unity `Camera` component for direct access.

Within LCK, this interface allows the service ([`ILckService`](/api-reference/interface/ILckService)) and mediator components to register, switch, and control cameras in a consistent way, regardless of whether the implementation is the built-in [`LckCamera`](/api-reference/class/LckCamera) or a custom one.

---

## Usage

To use a camera with the system, implement `ILckCamera` in your own component. See `LckCamera` for a simple implementation example.
