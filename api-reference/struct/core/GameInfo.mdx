description: "Struct containing metadata about the game and engine configuration, passed to LckCore during initialization."

## Description

**GameInfo** is a struct is used by [`LckCore.Initialize`](/api-reference/class/core/LckCore) to register the application with the SDK and ensure proper compatibility reporting.

---

## Usage

You typically create and populate a `GameInfo` struct during game startup, then pass it to [`LckCore.Initialize`](/api-reference/class/core/LckCore):

```c#
var gameInfo = new GameInfo
{
    GameName = "My Awesome Game",
    GameVersion = "1.0.0",
    ProjectName = "MyProject",
    CompanyName = "MyStudio",
    EngineVersion = Application.unityVersion,
    RenderPipeline = "URP",
    GraphicsAPI = SystemInfo.graphicsDeviceType.ToString()
};

var initResult = LckCore.Initialize("tracking-id-123", gameInfo);

if (!initResult.IsOk)
{
    Debug.LogError($"Initialization failed: {initResult.Message}");
}
```
