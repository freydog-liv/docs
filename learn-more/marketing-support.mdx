Once you’ve integrated the LCK into your app, LIV would love to help spread the word about your update. You can reach us anytime at [**hi@liv.tv**](mailto:hi@liv.tv), and we’ll work with you on how best to showcase your game to our community and content creators.

While we can’t promote every integration due to volume, we still encourage you to get in touch. We’re especially excited to hear from you if you’ve built unique camera implementations, are planning giveaways, or would like to offer early access to our **LCK Testing Squad** for feedback and content creation.
