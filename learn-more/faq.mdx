### **Will LCK impact the performance of my game?**

LCK is designed to be minimally impacting. However, LCK does trigger up to one additional render per game frame, so general good rendering practices will be important to keep the impact of LCK as low as possible.

As a developer you are also free to customize the rendering of the LCK cameras to apply project specific optimizations.

### **Which Unity render pipelines are supported?**

Both URP and the Built-in renderer is supported.

### **Why is the video framerate lower than what I set?**

LCK renders on frame updates, so the video framerate can only be equal or lower than the game framerate. The video framerate you set can be considered the _target_ video framerate.

### **What gets captured in Mixed Reality Passthrough modes?**

Passthrough footage is not available to application developers, and so it will not be included in the video. If you want to customize the visuals that are captured you can change the clear color of the LCK capture camera.

### **The video captured by LCK looks different to the in-game render?**

LCK uses built Unity Cameras to perform renders, and so you have to make sure these are configured the same way as your player cameras if you want the output to look the same.

### **I'm changing settings on the ServiceHelper but it has no effect on the videos captured?**

There are capture settings directly on the tablet which are platform dependent. The `LckServiceHelper` does initialize the service with its settings, but they are overriden by the tablet. It's likely we will change the `LckServiceHelper` since this behaviour is not intuitive.
