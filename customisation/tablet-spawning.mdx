## Introduction

How you choose to spawn the camera in your game is entirely up to you. We encourage you to experiment with what best matches your game’s style and provides the smoothest user experience.

The best way to integrate the tablet is to make it feel _native_ to your game - something that belongs naturally in your world rather than feeling like an external tool. A seamless fit helps players stay immersed while encouraging them to use the feature more often.

Once you’ve decided on your camera spawning method, be sure to communicate it clearly to your players and creators. Make it intuitive and easy to discover directly in-game.

## In Game Object (Recommended)

We **strongly recommend** placing the camera spawn directly within the game scene, rather than hiding it behind menus or buttons.

Through our partnerships with various games, we’ve found this approach leads to a massive **5x increase in camera activity** and videos filmed compared to other methods.

To further enhance this experience, we suggest customizing the camera's design to align with your game’s setting and art style—for example, a steampunk camera case in a steampunk game.

### Example - UNDERDOGS

In _UNDERDOGS_, the developers have have modified the implementation of LCK to be integrated with their mech UI. The result is an LCK tool that feels custom built for the game - this allows players to remain fully immersed in the game world even while creating content.

### Example - Gorilla Tag

Another great example of this is the highly successful _Gorilla Tag_ implementation of LCK. In this game, users can pull the tablet directly from the wall. The design was tailored to match the game’s unique art style and strategically placed near the cosmetics station, ensuring easy access without breaking immersion.

## In Game Event

You may want the camera to play a specific role in your gameplay loop—for example, capturing a battle, a performance, or another key moment. This can be done by tying the camera’s availability to certain gameplay events.

For instance, one developer chose to spawn the camera only after a specific in-game event occurred, making it available exclusively during those moments.

While this can be a fun design choice, we don’t recommend it as the default approach. To maximize the number of players and creators capturing videos, the camera should ideally be available anywhere, anytime.

## Alternative Options:

- Spawn On Controller Button Press
- Gestures
- Game Menu
