## Intro

We’ve left how you spawn the camera in your game up to you. We encourage you to explore what fits the style of your game and choose what would make the best user experience.

If you do come up with a great way to spawn the camera, we’d love it if you could share and we could add it to our examples and for others to be inspired from.

Once you’ve decided on how to spawn the camera, please make sure you let your community of players and creators know, and try to make it obvious in-game.

## In Game Object (Recommended)

We **strongly recommend** placing the camera spawn directly within the game scene, rather than hiding it behind menus or buttons.

Through our partnerships with various games, we’ve found this approach leads to a massive **5x increase in camera activity** and videos filmed compared to other methods.

To further enhance this experience, we suggest customizing the camera's design to align with your game’s setting and art style—for example, a steampunk camera case in a steampunk game.

### **Example - UNDERDOGS**

In _UNDERDOGS_, the developers have have modified the implementation of LCK to be integrated with their mech UI. The result is an LCK tool that feels custom built for the game - this allows players to remain fully immersed in the game world even while creating content.

### **Example - Gorilla Tag**

Another great example of this is the highly successful _Gorilla Tag_ implementation of LCK. In this game, users can pull the tablet directly from the wall. The design was tailored to match the game’s unique art style and strategically placed near the cosmetics station, ensuring easy access without breaking immersion.

## In Game Event

You may want to use the camera in a specific way in your gameplay loop (eg. To capture a battle or song performance), you can do this using gameplay events.

One developer spawned the camera after a specific in-game event occurred. It was their gameplay choice to only have the camera available at these specific times.

We do not recommend this as a default solution because you want to optimize for as many players & creators making videos as possible, and that is partly dependent on being able to spawn the camera anywhere.

## Alternative Options:

- Spawn On Controller Button Press
- Gestures
- Game Menu

## Other Considerations

### User camera setting defaults

We’ve set reasonable default ranges for user settings, like smoothing, field of view, and distance. However it could be optimized to best suit your app’s use cases and scenes. For example, if your game takes place mainly indoors the distance ranges could be smaller so you’re not outside the scene.

### Sounds

Default input sounds are included in the SDK but as a developer you are free to customize the audio clips used.
