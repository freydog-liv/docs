## Intro

We’ve left how you spawn the camera in your game up to you. We encourage you to explore what fits the style of your game and choose what would make the best user experience.

If you do come up with a great way to spawn the camera, we’d love it if you could share and we could add it to our examples and for others to be inspired from.

Once you’ve decided on how to spawn the camera, please make sure you let your community of players and creators know, and try to make it obvious in-game.

## In Game Object (Recommended)

We **strongly recommend** placing the camera spawn directly within the game scene, rather than hiding it behind menus or buttons.

Through our partnerships with various games, we’ve found this approach leads to a massive **5x increase in camera activity** and videos filmed compared to other methods.

To further enhance this experience, we suggest customizing the camera's design to align with your game’s setting and art style—for example, a steampunk camera case in a steampunk game.

### **Example - UNDERDOGS**

In _UNDERDOGS_, the developers have have modified the implementation of LCK to be integrated with their mech UI. The result is an LCK tool that feels custom built for the game - this allows players to remain fully immersed in the game world even while creating content.

### **Example - Gorilla Tag**

Another great example of this is the highly successful _Gorilla Tag_ implementation of LCK. In this game, users can pull the tablet directly from the wall. The design was tailored to match the game’s unique art style and strategically placed near the cosmetics station, ensuring easy access without breaking immersion.
