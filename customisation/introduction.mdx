## Overview

LCK manages standard Unity Camera components through the **LckCamera**, which captures video and audio at the target framerate and sends them to the encoder. These captures can also be previewed or further processed using an **LckMonitor**.

Since LCK builds directly on Unity’s native cameras, all existing camera settings and rendering options remain available. Recording control—such as choosing which camera to capture from or when to start and stop—is handled by an [LckService ](/api-reference/LckService) instance, which you create before beginning a session.

Instead of passing direct object references, cameras and monitors are managed using string IDs. This design makes it easier to organize components across different parts of a project without tightly coupling them.

Once a camera is activated through the service, it immediately starts capturing, with its output available in the `LckMonitor`. You can also switch between cameras seamlessly—even during recording—for smooth, uninterrupted transitions.

## Core

These MonoBehaviours are the main ones you will need when using LCK. They all connect the `LckService` to Unity gameobjects to allow easy control over the capture behaviour.

### LckServiceHelper

A simple helper to get a baseline [LckService](/api-reference/lckservice)  up and running, tying its lifetime to a GameObject.

If you want the service to persist across \_s_cene loads, you must keep the **LckServiceHelper** GameObject alive.

### LckCamera

Connects a regular Unity Camera component with the LCK system.

### **Fields**

| Field      | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| \_camera   | Camera | Reference to the Unity Camera that should be managed.                                                                                                  |
| \_cameraId | string | Optional ID for the camera. If unset, a UUID is auto-generated. Setting this to `"MyCamera"` allows you to reference it via the service using that ID. |

### **Methods**

| Method               | Returns | Description                                                                 |
| -------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CameraId             | string  | Returns the ID of the LCK Camera (useful when passing to the `LckService`). |
| GetCameraComponent() | Camera  | Returns the underlying Unity Camera.                                        |

### LckMonitor

Provides access to the current active capture `RenderTexture`, which can be displayed or processed further.

**Fields**

| Field        | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                |
| ------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `_monitorId` | `string` | Optional ID for the monitor. If unset, a UUID is auto-generated. Setting this to `"MyMonitor"` allows you to reference it via the service. |

**Events**

| Event                | Type                                 | Description                                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OnRenderTextureSet` | `LckMonitorRenderTextureSetDelegate` | Fired whenever LCK creates a new render texture for the main output. Allows you to track and use the currently active camera’s render texture. |
