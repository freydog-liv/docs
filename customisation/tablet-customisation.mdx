## Tablet Mesh

We strongly encourage developers to customize the tablet’s look and feel so it blends seamlessly with the style and atmosphere of their game. When creating new meshes, think about practical considerations such as different use cases, accessibility, and how easily the design can adapt to future features that may be added to the LCK tablet.

If you’d like support testing or evaluating your custom design, [reach out to us](/learn-more/contact-us). We can test the tablet within your game and provide feedback on the overall user experience.

## Camera Settings

We’ve provided sensible default ranges for user settings such as smoothing, field of view, and distance. However, these can be fine-tuned to better fit your game’s specific use cases and environments. For example, if most of your gameplay takes place indoors, you may want to reduce the distance range so the camera doesn’t end up outside the scene.

## **Sounds**

The SDK comes with default input sounds, but you can fully customize them to match your game’s style.

We recommend tailoring these sounds to feel native to your world—for example, futuristic beeps and holographic chimes for a sci-fi setting, or warm wooden clicks and rustles for a fantasy environment. Small audio details like these help reinforce immersion and make the camera experience feel more at home in your game.
