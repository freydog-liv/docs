### Step 1: Set up LCK

Set up your LCK and Player settings to support the tablet.

    3. Add your project's name to the **Game Name**  field.

      <Step title="Add Tablet Prefab" stepNumber={3} titleSize="p">

  <Accordion title="Configure Layers" icon="layer-group">
    Configure project layers.

    - Add a layer called **LCK Tablet** to your project layers.

  <Accordion title="Configure Input" icon="joystick">
    Set up LCK to work with the input system used in your project.

    <Card title="Direct Input" icon="hand-back-point-up">

### Step 3: Test

Build and test your game to verify LCK has been installed and added correctly.

<Accordion title="Build and Test" icon="rocket">
  <Steps>
    <Step title="Build">
      - Build and install your project normally, and run the game on your headset.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Test">
      - In headset, grab your tablet by the handles.
      - Tap **Record**
      - Switch between selfie, first-person and third-person views, and play around with the various camera controls like Follow, Distance and FOV to ensure it is working as expected.
      - Tap **Stop** to save the recording.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Review">
      - Check your recording in headset at **Storage/Movies/\<RecordingAlbumName\>** or for PCVR at **\<User\>/Videos/\<RecordingAlbumName\>**
