## Add LCK in three easy steps

### Step 1: Configure your project

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Configure LCK Settings" icon="gear">
    Go to the LCK project settings under **Edit/Project Settings/LCK**

    - Set the **Tracking ID**  (provided when set up your account on the [LCK Dashboard](https://dashboard.liv.tv/dev/login?welcome=false))
    - Add your project's name to the  **Game Name**  field.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Configure Player Settings " description="Android only" icon="folder-gear">

### Step 2: Add the tablet

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Add Tablet and Service" icon="aperture">
    - Go to **Packages/LIV Creator Kit/Runtime/Prefabs**
    - Drag the **LCK Service Helper** prefab into your scene.
    - Navigate to the **Tablets** folder and add the **LCK Tablet** prefab that matches your interaction framework and input style, or use **Base LCK Tablet** to set up your own input system.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Configure Layers" icon="layer-group">
    Add a layer called **LCK Tablet** to your project layers.

    <Info>
      LCK will automatically use this to hide the tablet geometry from LCK cameras where necessary.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Configure Input" icon="joystick">
    Set up LCK to work with the input system used in your project.

    <Card title="Direct Input" icon="hand-back-point-up">
      Ensure your hand colliders have the tag **Hand** or whatever tag you set in **Project Settings/LCK/Trigger Enter Tag** (by default this is Hand)
    </Card>
    <Card title="Raycast" icon="arrow-down-right">
      Ensure that the **Raycast Mask** for the **Ray Interactor** includes both **Default** and **UI** layers.
