## About LCK

The LIV Creator Kit (LCK) is a flexible, modular, and lightweight SDK that allows users to record & stream themselves directly within your VR game or app.

**LCK is 100% free for all game developers**, for other uses [contact us](/learn-more/contact-us).

The SDK includes a plug-and-play camera prefab that can be easily dragged and dropped into any compatible project and a fully featured scripting API to create custom camera prefabs or systems.
